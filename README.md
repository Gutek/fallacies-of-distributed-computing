# Fallacies of distributed computing

Diagrams that can be used to describe or help to illustrate fallacies of distributed computing

## Illustrations

All illustrations were made using [draw.io](https://draw.io).

All are somehow based on what I've seen during my google search - ideas picked from here and there. I've just placed them in one place so everyone can benefit from it.

## Fallacies

### 1 The network is reliable
### 2 Latency is zero
### 3 Bandwidth is infinite
### 4 The network is secure
### 5 Topology doesn't change
### 6 There is one administrator
### 7 Transport cost is zero
### 8 The network is homogeneous

## Contribution

You can update, change and do whatever you like with diagrams. if you want improve it, feel free to create PR with changes. If you don't like draw.io feel free to propose different format :) I've used as it was the simplest possible option for me. If not, use `fallacies.drawio` file and just update it :) you can also generate final files too by exporting them to PNG.
